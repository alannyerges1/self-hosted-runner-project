A complete DevOps pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, a **Windows self-hosted runner**, **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and a **Node.js test application**.

This project builds, tests, packages, and automatically redeploy an application using **infrastructure that you control**, without relying on GitHub-hosted runners.



### CI Pipeline 
- Runs on a self-hosted Windows GitHub Actions runner
- Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
- Executes automated unit tests with **Jest**
- Builds a production-ready **Docker image**
- Runs tests **inside the container** for full environment validation
- Saves and uploads Docker images as CI artifacts

###  **CD Pipeline**
- Downloads the latest Docker image artifact
- Removes old containers safely
- Uses **Docker Compose** to deploy the updated application
- Automatically restarts the app with zero manual intervention
